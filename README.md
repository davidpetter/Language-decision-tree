# Work in progress!

# Deciding on a fit for purpose a programming language
Opinionated Programming Language Decision Tree.

# Prerequisites
**TODO** [Security architecture]()
**TODO** [API Integration architecture]()
**TODO** [Client architecture and mesh service architecture]()

## Shortlist
List of considered/evaluated languages
- C# / .NET (Core)
- Clojure
- Elixir
- Erlang
- Go
- Groovy
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- C++
- Dart
- Java
- Node.js
- Objective-C
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust
- Scala
- Swift
- TypeScript

# Decision tree
## Backend
 - Clojure
  + TODO
 - Go
  + General purpose solution, self written. GO-to language, efficient and fast
 - Java
  + For the purpose of Libraries and ecosystem
 - Javascript/Node.js
  + For the purpose of Libraries and ecosystem 
 - Python
  + Maths, AI and machine learning
  + Optimise for IO
 - C# (.net core)
  + When domain logic is complex and messy and GO has failed.

## Frontend/client
 - Browser
  - Javascript
  - TypeScript
 - Mobile
    - **TODO** - A bit messy at the moment
