# Work in progress!

# Deciding on a fit for purpose a programming language
Opinionated Programming Language Decision Tree.

# Prerequisites
Micros service architecture (service mesh), singe page applications and backend for front-end.

- [Security architecture]()
- [API Integration architecture]()
- [Client architecture and mesh service architecture]()

## Shortlist
List of considered/evaluated languages
- C# / .NET (Core)
- Clojure
- Elixir
- Erlang
- Go
- Groovy
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- C++
- Dart
- Java
- Node.js
- Objective-C
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust
- Scala
- Swift
- TypeScript

# Decision tree
## Backend
 - Go
    - General purpose solution, self written. GO-to language, efficient and fast
 - Java/Kotlin
   - For Libraries and ecosystem
 - Javascript/Node.js
   - For the purpose of Libraries and ecosystem 
 - Python
   - Maths, BI and AI. Optimise for IO
 - C# (.net core)
   - Consider removing? Optionally second in line after Go, i.e when problem is to big for GO or there is a ecosystem fit

## Frontend/client
 - Browser
   - Javascript
   - TypeScript
 - Mobile (when native is needed)
   - Swift
   - Kotlin
