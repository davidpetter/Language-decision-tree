# Work in progress!

# Deciding on a fit for purpose a programming language
Opinionated Programming Language Decision Tree.

# Prerequisites
Micros service architecture (service mesh) that allows polyglot languages. PWA or SPA and backend for front-end.

- [Security architecture]()
- [API Integration architecture]()
- [Application architecture]()

## Shortlist
List of considered/evaluated languages
- C# / .NET (Core)
- Clojure
- Elixir
- Erlang
- Go
- Groovy
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- C++
- Dart
- Java
- Node.js
- Objective-C
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust
- Scala
- Swift
- TypeScript

# Decision tree
## Backend
 ### Go
 General purpose solution, self written. GO-to language, efficient and fast.

 ### Java/Kotlin
 For Libraries and ecosystem
 ### Javascript/Node.js
 For the purpose of Libraries and ecosystem
 ### Python
   - Maths, BI and AI. Optimise for IO
   - Scripting
   - Prototyping
   - For the purpose of Libraries and ecosystem
 ### C# (.net core)
   - When there is a fit in echosystem (like Service fabric etc.)
   - Application is a bit to large for GO
   - Want to use MVC for frontend.

## Frontend/client
 - Browser
   - Javascript
   - TypeScript
 - Mobile (when native is needed)
   - Swift
   - Kotlin
